# Value-vs.-Growth-Smart-Beta-Strategy


**Abstract:** Value investing was established as a smart beta strategy twenty years ago. However, empirical evidence suggested that it might have lost attractiveness in the recent ten years. This study applied the Capital Asset Pricing Model and the Fama-French-Carhart Four Factors Model to evaluate the ten-year performance of iShares S&P 500 Value ETF (IVE), which tracks the performance of large capitalization value stocks in the United States, using the S&P 500 Index as a benchmark and IVEâ€™s major competitor, Vanguard S&P 500 Value ETF (VOOV), as a comparison. This study found that value investing has lost its value in the past decade, especially under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
